Architecture prediction is Web API for prediction architectural styles of buildings by images.

## Installation
Arcitecture-recognition-api requires some dependencies to run:
  - [Python version 3.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-352/)
  - [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)

Install packages:
```sh
$ pip install --upgrade tensorflow
$ pip install numpy
$ pip install scipy
$ pip install opencv-python
$ pip install matplotlib

## Technical task:
 - User is able to create an account in system
 - User is able to sign in
 - User is able to upload image of building
 - User is able to review results of architectural style prediction
 - User is able to save result of prediction
 - User is able to review saved results
 - User is able to sort saved results by name, date, architectural style
 - User is able to read description of availiable architectural styles

## Ways to develop project:
  - adapt project for mobile using
  - object detection: detect building on photos and predict architectural styles for them 
  - fix performance
